1. General presentation :
  - Project Title : FORT BOYARD SIMULATOR

  - Contributors:

        - Camille Lubrano Lavaderci (role : completed the mathematics and the père Fouras challenge, the utility fonctions, and the README.file)
        - Ethan Sauvanet (role : completed the main file; chance, logical and final challenge)
  
  - Description: The project is an insparation of the famous television game Fort Boyard. The game consists of collecting keys by winning mini-games. Once the player collects three keys, they unlock a final challenge to win.
  
  - Key features : The challenges proposed to the players are various and requires to think, which offers a very diverse game and intellectual stimulation. We can also add that this game is played with multiple players which creates a team bonding
  
  - Technologies used:

        - programming language : Python
        - library : random, json
        - tools : Git and Github
  
  - Installation :

        - To clone Git repository run the following code with 'username' as the GitHub user's username and 'repository-name' with the name of the repository you wish to clone.
        git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
        - Firstly make sure you have Git and Node.js, then install Dependencies and then set up configuration

  - How to use :
   
        -  Simply follow the instructions on screen, to execute the application : go to the file main.py and run.


2. Technical documentation
  - Game algorithm : Firstly initialize the game, the choose the type of challenge and player, generate randmly a challenge and then track the player actions, repeat challenges, end the game

  - Prototype Functions : The functions we implemented in the game

        - Introduction() : introduces the players to the game and the rules
        - compose_equipe() : allows the player to set their roles and register and for the programm to keep track of their won keys 
        - challenges_menu() : allows the players to pick the type of challenge they want to play 
        - choose_player(team) : the players can with this function choose which player will be playing the mini-game

- Input and error management :
  
        - Error messages such as 'Enter a new valid value' are used when unavailable values or commands are entered, to do this we make blocks that check if what is enterted is correct
        - Infinite loop, Incompatible Operations Between Different Date Types, Syntax Error, Calling a non object, modifying immutable object, unhandled exceptions


3. Logbook

 - Project chronology : We worked on the project trought the timeline and divided as much as possible. We made sure to start the functions not to late to be able to do the main program

 - Task distribution : On the first day we worked on the projetc we divided the tasks between the both of us, we agreed on Camille to do the mathematics and the père Fouras challenge, the utility fonctions, and the README.file and Ethan the main file, chance, logical and final challenge

4. Testing and Validation
- we tested all of the possible outcomes of our programs to ensure that they were correct and that there would be no errors. We tested functions of each challenge, the functions in the utility functions and finaly the main functions
