1. General presentation :
  - Project Title : FORT BOYARD SIMULATOR

  - Contributors:

        - Camille Lubrano Lavaderci (role : completed the mathematics and the père Fouras challenge, the utility fonctions, and the README.file)
        - Ethan Sauvanet (role : main file, chance, logical and final challenge)
  
  - Description: The project consists of collecting keys by winning mini-games. One the player collects three keys, they unlock a final challenge to win the game.
  
  - Key features :
  
  - Technologies used:

        - programming language : Python
        - library : random, json
        - tools : Git and Github
  
  - Installation :

        - To clone Git repository run the following code with 'username' as the GitHub user's username and 'repository-name' with the name of the repository you wish to clone.
        git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
        - Firstly make sure you have Git and Node.js, then install Dependencies and then set up configuration

  - How to use :
   
        -  To start the application, you can run the following command: npm start


2. Technical documentation
  - Game algorithm :

  - Functions :

        - Introduction() : introduces the players to the game and the rules
        - compose_equipe() : allows the player to set their roles and register and for the programm to keep track of their won keys 
        - challenges_menu() : allows the players to pick the type of challenge they want to play 
        - choose_player(team) : the players can with this function choose which player will be playing the mini-game

- Input and error management :
  
        - Error messages such as 'Enter a new valid value' are used when unavailable values or commands are entered, to do this we make blocks that check if what is enterted is correct
        - A few known bugs : File not found (when attempting to open a file that doesn't exist), Operator issues (certain operators can not fonction with certain values or variable types, for exemple dividing by zero), invalid syntax (issues in syntax)


3. Logbook

 - Project chronology : We worked on the project trought the timeline, 

 - Task distribution : On the first day we worked on the projetc we divided the tasks between the both of us, we agreed on Camille to do the mathematics and the père Fouras challenge, the utility fonctions, and the README.file and Ethan the main file, chance, logical and final challenge

4. Testing and Validation
- we tested all of the possible outcomes of our programs to ensure that they were correct
